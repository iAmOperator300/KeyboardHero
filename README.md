# KeyboardHero
Keyboard Hero! A Temu Guitar Hero, but for computers!
How to play: 
  -A ; = Red  S L = Blue D K = Yellow F J = Cyan. ASDF = Left  JKL; = Right.
  -When the pucks get in/mostly in the green zone, press the corresponding key.
  -Press "SPACE" to end the game and show your total points.
  -Levels last 30 seconds, and get increase in speed as you progress
  -Pressing a key when the corresponding puck is NOT in the green causes a mistake
  -A missed puck causes a mistake
  -25 Mistakes causes the game to end

Needed Updates & Fixes:
The lowest sliding (highest Y value) puck needs to blank out when the key is pressed before the puck reaches the green
Difficulty settings (Amount of pucks that can spawn at once, speed of the pucks, same colored pucks)
Temporary Audio - Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Te, Do play to proper hit notes and white noise to mistakes
Audio (Game 2.0) - Add songs to the game and spawn the pucks in according to the timing of the guitar/drums/bass in the song.
Visual (Game 3.0) - Change the appearance to look like a hacker-battle game. The more you get correct, the closer you get to hacking. The mistakes lean the bar towards you. You can also get hacked back, same battle concept.
Story (Game 4.0) - Make a storyline to go along with the hacking battles, adding some entertainment to the game.
